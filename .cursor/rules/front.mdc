- Generate API clients with **Orval from OpenAPI specs**.
- Manage global state with **Zustand** as a lightweight alternative to Redux.
- Ensure **responsive UI** with Mantine and Tailwind CSS.
- Follow **component-driven development** and modularize UI.
- Explore **React Server Components and Suspense** for performance optimization.
- Implement PWA support when relevant.

# **Testing & Quality Assurance**
## **Frontend (Jest/Vitest, Cypress)**
- Unit test components with **Jest/Vitest**.
- Implement **end-to-end (E2E) tests** with Cypress.
- Mock API calls to prevent flaky tests.

# **Performance Optimization**
- Implement **lazy loading and code splitting** in frontend.

This rule set ensures best practices, maintainability, and high-performance web applications using modern frontend technologies.
